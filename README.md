# 🦾 Kinematics Package for General Research

This is a customized kinematics package designed for general-purpose robotics research.  
It supports URDF parsing, kinematic tree construction, chain-based forward/inverse kinematics, and collision checking.

## 📁 Demos

You can explore the core functionalities through interactive Jupyter notebooks located in the `code/demo/` folder:

- `01.demo_parser.ipynb` – URDF parsing and robot model loading  
- `02.demo_chain.ipynb` – Building kinematic chains from the parsed model  
- `03.demo_kinematics.ipynb` – Forward and inverse kinematics computation  
- `04.demo_rviz.ipynb` – Visualizing robot structure and pose in RViz  
- `05.demo_fcl.ipynb` – Basic collision checking using FCL  
- `06.demo_fcl_for_robot.ipynb` – Robot-specific collision detection in operational context

These demos provide a step-by-step guide for using the kinematics package in both simulation and real-robot applications.
